I have trained a Random Forest classifier for terrorist group name attribute in the global terrorism database. I have implemented several preprocessing techniques, encoded the data for better classification. Implemented feature selection using two methods correlation and feature importance with random forest classifier and narrowed down the used features in the multiclassifier model which inturn improved the performance of the model.
